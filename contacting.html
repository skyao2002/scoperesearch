              Emails can take many forms, we have attached a sample format below
              but feel free to do whatever format you think is best! Make sure
              to read some of their papers so you have some background on their
              research.
            </p>

            <h3>Example Email:</h3>
            <div
              style="background-color: rgba(144, 144, 144, 0.25); padding: 2vw"
            >
              <b>
                <p>Dear Dr. [Insert Name],</p>
                <p>
                  Introduce yourself in this first paragraph, as if you are
                  talking with them in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Explain what about their work interests you, perhaps read a
                  few of their research papers so you can become better
                  acquainted with their interests and field of study. If you can
                  think of a question or two to ask, feel free to do so, but it
                  is not necessary. It is more important to convey a sense of
                  interest and show your passion about their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The third paragraph can be more personal and can help the
                  professor/researcher to learn more about you. Use this
                  paragraph to show your own personal interests and passions,
                  why this lab is for you and what you want to contribute to the
                  lab. Ask for a meeting, if it is possible, this will further
                  convey your commitment and interest in their research and help
                  you gain a better understanding of who they are and what they
                  do. Do not forget to thank or show your appreciation for their
                  time, because researching is a privilege not a right.
                </p>

            <h4>General Advice & Tips</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The emails for professors and researchers can be found on the
                faculty page for the specific institution you are interested in!
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a list of professors you are interested in performing
                research with. If the professor you email does not reply in
                about 3 days, send an email to another professor.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is important to remember to be respectful, gracious, and,
                most importantly, show interest in their research.
              </li>

              <li>
                Make sure your emails are grammatically correct and well thought
                out. If you would like some feedback regarding your email, feel
                free to email us!
              </li>

              <li>
                Sometimes professors are not interested in having high school
                students in their labs, are busy that semester or summer, or
                simply do not respond. Do not take any of these personally!
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure to check the email carefully before you send! Make
                sure you have addressed the professor correctly and attached
                your resume/CV.
