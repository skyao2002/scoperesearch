								<h2>Why Me?</h2>
								<p>Why taking on students can <strong>benefit you:</strong></p>
									
								<ul>
									<li>High school students can help you obtain grants, since applications for grants that further high school education generally get funded.</li>
									<li>High school students are eager and diligent individuals.</li>
									<li>High school students have minds without preconceptions that can be useful when it comes to making creative leaps. </li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Commonly Asked Questions:</h2>
								<h4>What are the expectations for us as professors?</h4>
								<p>Well, the expectations are whatever you feel comfortable with. After reviewing the student's resume or interviewing the student via Zoom, feel free to assign the student with whatever projects and responsibilities you think is the best fit for them. 
								</p>

								<h4>When will the research appointments take place, especially during this pandemic?</h4>
								<p>If the research that you specialize in is virtual, then the research appointment can start anytime you and the student decide will work best for both of you. If the work you specialize in requires you and the student to be in person in a laboratory, 
									it seems like the spring and summer semester will be a good bet. We do not have a set start and end time for each appointment, that is something you and the student of your choosing will need to decide together. </p>

								<h4>What will we do on the website? What if I do not want to post but I still need students?</h4>
								<p>The purpose of the website is to connect motivated high school students to you. All you need to do is post information regarding projects that you do not mind allowing high school students working on. The student will then email you their information 
									and then your research journeys together can begin. If you do not feel comfortable posting, please contact us and we will post from our admin account. More information about how to use the website can be found on the website tutorial page. </p>

								<h4>NOTE:</h4>
								<p>Please update us through email (contactscoperesearch@gmail.com) or with the below survey about your experiences with the students you have connected with through our platform so we can provide a better service for you.</p>
