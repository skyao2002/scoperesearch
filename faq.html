          <p>Common questions students have about research.</p>

            <h3>What is the value of research? Why should I do it?</h3>
            <p>
              Research can open your eyes to new career opportunities and help
              you gain experience in the scientific field. Although it is not
              the most important aspect, research will be very beneficial in
              your college application process and when you search for
              scholarships. Research is one of the few opportunities students
              can do to change the world. Also, sometimes there is compensation.
            </p>

            <h3>Is there a minimum age to do research in a lab?</h3>
            <p>
              Generally, a student needs to be at least 15. Different research
              programs and labs may have an alternative age minimum.
            </p>

            <h3>
              There is a pandemic currently. How can I participate in research
              when institutions are in lockdown?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are two types of research: wet and dry. Wet lab essentially
              consists of performing experiments in a laboratory. Dry lab
              consists of doing research outside of the lab, like at home. The
              subjects that are dry lab are generally computer science related
              or more of the humanities. Dry lab will probably be your best bet
              during a pandemic.
            </p>

            <h3>
              I really want to participate in research, but I am scared I am not
              knowledgeable enough in the field. What should I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Don't worry! Professors and other researchers do not expect you to
              know very much when you begin. Just make sure to be open-minded
              and give it your all!
            </p>

            <h3>
              I live very far away from any research institution. Is there a way
              for me to conduct research still?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes! Dry lab is probably your best option, since dry lab can be
              done anywhere.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Scientific papers are really difficult to read, how can I
              efficiently read and understand these papers?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Scientific papers are really difficult to read initially, but
              check out our "How to read papers" page to understand the
              techniques you can use to approach reading scientific papers.
